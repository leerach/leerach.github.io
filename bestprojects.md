<h2>Evictions in SF 3D Data Visualization</h2>
<h4>Python | JavaScript</h4>
<ul class="actions"> 
	<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://github.com/leerach/sf-evictions';">Github</button>
</ul>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> ● Constructed 3D geospatial visualizations of eviction notices to analyze communities within San Francisco most impacted by evictions by integrating Deck.gl and NodeJS while using public data. <br>
	● Predicted rate of growth of evictions over time 1997 to present using machine learning algorithms and tools for time series forecasting such as linear regression, kNN, Prophet, and ARIMA.

<h2>Enrollment Graph Visualization</h2>
<h4>JavaScript | HTML5 | PHP </h4>
<ul class="actions"> 
	<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://enrollment-graph.herokuapp.com/';">Demo</button>
</ul>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> ● Redesigned entire front-end visual representation of enrollment graph for Berkeley Law courses using Chart.js to create an aesthetic and user interactive interface for multiline charts pulling data from external APIs. <br>
	● Assisted in building back-end server-side by extracting and storing data from JSON files.
	</p>

<h2>Gitlet: Recreation of Git</h2>
<h4>Java </h4>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> ● Created from scratch a working implementation of the git version-control system starting from the detailed design documentation to structure each component and replicate the core functionalities. <br>
	● Learned how to apply persistence to preserve each state of the program and utilize graph traversals to handle merge conflicts and criss-cross merges.

<h2>Lines of Action Board Game</h2>
<h4>Java </h4>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> Implemented the functionality of the manual player and 
	utilized game trees, heuristics, and minimax algorithms to create an efficient AI to beat its opponent.
	 Based on the board game Lines of Action by Claude Soucie.</p>

<h2>Enigma Machine</h2>
<h4>Java </h4>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> Recreated the German Enigma machine used in WWII to encrypt and decode messages, 
	programming the permutations, substitution ciphers, and configurations of each interchangeable component of the system.  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="content">Typing Speed Measurer</h2>
<h4>Python </h4>
<div class="row"> 
	<p> Wrote a program that measures typing speed and implements autocorrect with data abstraction, tree recursion, and containers. </p>

<h2 id="content">Autonomous Object Detection</h2>
<h4>Java | OpenCV</h4>
<ul class="actions"> 
	<button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://github.com/leerach/team3470/tree/master/teamcode';">GitHub</button>
</ul>
<div class="row"> 
	<p>● Optimized color and shape detection in phone camera by incorporating open source computer vision software to enhance real-time image processing and communication with external sensors. <br>
	● Mapped robot motors and servos to controls and programmed the autonomous trajectory of the robot in Java. Utilized phone camera communications with robot to enhance object detection with OpenCV to accurately identify an object's shape and color. </p>
