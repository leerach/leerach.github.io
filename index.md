I am currently a first-year Computer Science undergraduate at UC Berkeley. 
I love exploring new places, meeting new people, and learning about the growing field of computer science and its implications in improving our world. 
Some of my hobbies include avid investing, reading up on the tech industry, and de-stressing by playing the piano or making new memories with my friends :)
